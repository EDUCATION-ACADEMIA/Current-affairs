<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When the couple approached Zhang for help, he decided to try the mitochondrial transfer procedure. He took the nucleus from one of the woman’s eggs and inserted it into a healthy donor’s egg that had had its own nucleus removed. He then fertilised the egg with the husband’s sperm.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The six-pound boy, who the doctors say in a statement is healthy, was born using a technique called maternal spindle transfer. In the procedure, the grouped-together DNA from a mother’s egg was removed and placed inside a donor egg from another woman, which had been emptied of its DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A baby boy, the first child to be born using a new technique that incorporates DNA from three people, is now five months old. It is great news – the birth of a healthy baby conceived by this new procedure is a major step forward and will lead to a new way of preventing the inheritance of mitochondrial diseases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-three-parent baby, human offspring produced from the genetic material of one man and two women through the use of assisted reproductive technologies, specifically mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT) and three-person in vitro fertilization (IVF).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-LONDON: Britain today created history by becoming the first country to legalise children conceived with DNA from three parents after lawmakers voted in favour of the controversial procedure that sparked a fierce ethical debate with senior Church figures.
