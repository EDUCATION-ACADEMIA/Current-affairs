Notes: Tony Lewis devised the Duckworth-Lewis along with a mathematician Frank Duckworth, which is a mathematical formula used to determine the winner in cricket games that are affected by bad weather.The DLS methods sets targets (and decides outcomes) by calculating how many runs teams should score (and would have scored) if the resources available to both sides were equal. To calculate a target, the formula may simply be expressed thus: Team 2s par score = Team 1s score x (Team 2s resources/Team 1s resources).Definition: The Duckworth–Lewis system, devised by statisticians Frank Duckworth and Tony Lewis (and lately modified by Steve Stern), was invented in the 1990s as a replacement for alternative rules on what to do if it rained during cricket games.The DLS method is a mathematical formulation applied in case of rain or any undesirable circumstances that shortens the time of the match.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Q. Tony-Lewis, who devised DLS method, recently passed away. DLS is a mathematical formula associated with which game? Notes: Tony Lewis devised the Duckworth-Lewis along with a mathematician Frank Duckworth, which is a mathematical formula used to determine the winner in cricket games that are affected by bad weather.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The DLS methods sets targets (and decides outcomes) by calculating how many runs teams should score (and would have scored) if the resources available to both sides were equal. To calculate a target, the formula may simply be expressed thus: Team 2’s par score = Team 1’s score x (Team 2’s resources/Team 1’s resources).
</p>

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Definition: The Duckworth–Lewis system, devised by statisticians Frank Duckworth and Tony Lewis (and lately modified by Steve Stern), was invented in the 1990s as a replacement for alternative rules on what to do if it rained during cricket games.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The DLS method is a mathematical formulation applied in case of rain or any undesirable circumstances that shortens the time of the match. The Duckworth-Lewis formula was conceived by British statisticians Frank Duckworth and Tony Lewis(hence the name) and first used in 1997. ICC adopted the method officially in 1999.

<strong>Concept note-5:
