<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-During the third day of the match, TV camera caught Australia opener Bancroft using sandpaper to rough up the ball. At the end of the day’s play, both Bancroft and Smith admitted to ball-tampering at a press conference.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Paine was Australia’s wicket-keeper in the game when Cameron Bancroft was caught live tampering with the ball using sandpaper against South Africa in the Cape Town Test. Bancroft’s footage soon went viral on social media and became a major talking point in the cricket fraternity as Cricket Australia sprung into action.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Yes, it’s something to be really proud of. But it is just a game. “I invested too much to the point where I lost control of my values. What had become important to me was being liked, being well valued, feeling really important to my teammates, like I was contributing something by using sandpaper on a cricket ball.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Warner was cast as the key villain in the scandal–dubbed “Sandpaper-gate”–having conspired with then-skipper Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft. Like Warner, Smith was banned from playing for a year and from captaining Australia, but his punishment lasted two years while Warner’s was indefinite.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Australian bowlers who played in the test, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Mitch Starc and Nathan Lyon, say they did not know a foreign substance was taken onto the field to alter the condition of the ball until they saw the images on the big screen at the ground.
